## Getting Started

After downloading the boilerplate, your first order of business is to open a terminal and run

```bash
yarn
```

or

```bash
npm install
```

Then, to start up the local server, run

```bash
npm start
```

Open a browser and hit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), and we are ready to roll.

## Build & deployment

Building the dist version of the project is as easy as running

```bash
npm run build
```

If you want to deploy, run

```bash
npm run deploy
```
