# User

export const Template = (args) => <User {...args} />;

The header package exports an `User` in order to display the logged in user of the page.  
The `name` property allows to set the name of the logged in user as a string. The `profile` allows you to show the profile of the logged in user.  
With that minimal configuration (just a name), the information is shown as plain text on the web page. If you want to display as a link and redirect towards a my account webpage (inside or outside the application), you can do it by using the `href` property that will set up the text as a link.  
By default, that link will have a 'Voir mon profil' text when hovering, but you can customize it by changing the value of the `title` property.

Don't forget to load the css file of the component.

```javascript
import '@axa-fr/react-toolkit-layout-header/dist/User/af-user.css';
```
